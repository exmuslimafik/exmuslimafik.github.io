 <h2>HACKED BY TeaM NETWORK9 </h2>
  <h3><font color="white"> We Are Bharatiya Hackers</font><br><br><font color="red">We have hacked your site in response to the recent inflammatory and offensive statements made by certain members of your government. The illiterate and racist remarks from figures like  Malsha, Hassan Zihan and Mariyam Shiuna are not only shameful but also detrimental to the diplomatic relationship between our nations.<br><font color="white">It is crucial to remind you of the historical assistance and support your country has received from us. The disrespectful comments about our culture and the apparent amnesia about past aid and collaboration are deeply disappointing. The current state of your government, with leaders like Mohammed Muizzu and Shiuna, reflects poorly on your nation.</br><font color="red">  Consider this a warning, the continuation of such hate speech and racism will not be tolerated. We are capable of taking actions that could severely impact your cyber space. It is in your best interest to cease this provocation immediately and reflect on the potential consequences.

Our preference is for a constructive and peaceful resolution to differences between our nations. However, we will not hesitate to respond decisively if this pattern of behavior persists.Think carefully about the direction your government is taking, as it may lead to severe repercussions. Jai Shree Ram. Jai Hind Jai Bharat
